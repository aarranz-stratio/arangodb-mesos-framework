# Open Issues

## Configuration

Where to store the initial configuration? I. e. the original agencies. If we
shutdown the cluster and start it up again, we need to find the slaves that hold
the data for your agencies.

The same is true for the inital resource configuration: Where to store these
values?

## How to distribute ArangoDB?

Using docker containers is the simplest way to distribute ArangoDB to the
slave. Is this always a good idea? I. e. better to provide a tar for the
architecture?

## How to get the real resource usage?

There are message with the "real" resource usage? How to receive these?  Or is
DCOS handling the case, that a task reaches its limit?  If so, how is it
handled?

## How to shutdown a slave for maintenance?

How do I know that a slave is shutting down for maintenance? No failover
necessary in this case.

## Do not try to reserve ports

Reserving ports will result in disaster: All resources for a framework are
merged. Port 12345 from slave A and slave B will be considered the same
"resource". Reserving port 12345 will result in a wrong total crashing
the master.

## Checkpoint for Frameworks?

How does it work?

## Mesos Container?

What is the preferred way? An executor? A Mesos container? A docker container? What are the differences?
